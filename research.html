    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Among many rule-based systems employed in classification problems, the belief rule-based (BRB) system has been significant for its ability to deal with both quantitative and qualitative information under uncertainty. However, it may face excessive information and low accuracy in some applications due to the limitations of the conventional BRB generation method. To this end, a greedy-based BRB learning method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the BRB is generated by selecting a reduced number of belief rules from a set of candidate rules. Then, the BRB learning process is conducted by exploiting a selection and reduction strategy, which searches and selects the optimal rules from candidate rules as well as removes noise and redundant rules. Moreover, the original procedures of the inference process and class estimation are retained from conventional BRB systems. Thirty standard classification benchmarks are tested to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, and the classification results are compared with existing rule-based systems, novel belief rule-based systems, and conventional machine learning methods. The comparison results show that the proposed method could achieve relatively satisfactory accuracy while having a significantly smaller BRB. Furthermore, the results derived from benchmarks with two or three classes show the superior performance of the proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art classification methods. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Dependence assessment, which is to assess the influence of the operator's failure of a task on the failure probability of subsequent tasks, is an important part in Human reliability analysis (HRA). The technique for human error rate prediction (THERP) has been widely applied to assess the dependence in HRA. However, due to the complexity of the real world, various kinds of uncertainty could occur in dependence assessment problem, and how to properly express and deal with uncertainty especially interval uncertainty remains a pressing issue. In this article, a novel method based on the interval evidential reasoning (IER) algorithm is proposed to assess dependence in HRA under interval uncertainty. First, dependence influential factors are identified and their functional relationship is determined. Then, judgments on these factors provided by the analysts are represented using interval belief distributions. Next, the interval evidential reasoning algorithm is employed to aggregate interval belief distributions of different factors according to their functional relationship while considering the credibility of the interval belief distribution. Finally, the conditional human error probability (CHEP) is calculated based on the fused interval belief distribution, where the upper and lower values are determined by assigning belief degree to the highest and lowest grade of the corresponding grade interval, respectively. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method not only properly deals with interval uncertainty using interval belief distribution and IER algorithm, but also provides a novel and effective way for dependence assessment in HRA. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Weapon system operational effectiveness evaluation is of significant importance to weapon system development, and it can be viewed as a multiple criteria decision-making problem with qualitative information, precise data, interval data, and even missing information. Furthermore, due to the complexity of weapon systems and military operations, using prior knowledge such as experiment data, simulation data, and experts’ knowledge could enhance the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation result. To this end, by introducing interval-valued evidential reasoning (ER) approach into belief rule-based system (BRBS), this paper proposed an interval-valued BRB inference method for weapon system operational effectiveness evaluation Firstly, the operational effectiveness evaluation hierarchy is established based on the analysis of the weapon system. Then, the belief rule base (BRB) is constructed to capture prior knowledge of the weapon system. Next, different kinds of information are transformed into belief distribution, and the proposed interval-valued BRB inference method is applied to relay the input to the BRB and obtain the evaluation result. Finally, three numerical examples of missile system operational effectiveness evaluation with interval data, precise data, and missing information are conducted to illustrate the process of the proposed method and demonstrate its feasibility. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Human reliability analysis (HRA) is of great significance for probabilistic risk assessment, and the technique for human error rate prediction (THERP) has been widely applied to assess the dependence among HRA. However, uncertainties in analyst's judgment and experts' knowledge, especially interval uncertainty in analyst's judgment, have been ignored by existing methods. To this end, the belief rule‐based system is employed to model uncertainties in experts' knowledge in this paper, and the interval belief distribution is used to model interval uncertainty in analyst's judgment. Then, a new belief rule‐based dependence assessment method is proposed, and two case studies are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could not only model uncertainty using belief rules and interval belief distributions, but also provide a novel and effective way for human reliability analysis. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Rule reduction is one of the focuses of numerous researches on belief-rule-based system, in some cases, too many redundant rules may be a concern to the rule-based system. Though rule reduction methods have been widely used in the belief-rule-based system, extended belief-rule-based system, which is an expansion of belief-rule-based system, still lacks methods to reduce and train rules in the extended belief rule base (EBRB). To this end, this paper proposes an EBRB reduction and training method. Based on the density-based spatial clustering applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a new EBRB reduction method is proposed, where all the rules in the EBRB will be visited and rules within the distance of the fusion threshold will be fused. Moreover, the EBRB training method using parameter learning, which uses a set of training data to train the parameters of EBRB, is also proposed to improve the accuracy of the EBRB system. Two case studies of regression and classification are used to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed EBRB reduction and training method. Comparison results show that the proposed method can effectively downsize the EBRB and increase the accuracy of EBRB system. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> The fading factor exerts a significant role in the strong tracking idea. However, traditional fading factor introduction method hinders the accuracy and robustness advantages of current strong-tracking-based nonlinear filtering algorithms such as Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) since traditional fading factor introduction method only considers the first-order Taylor expansion. To this end, a new fading factor idea is suggested and introduced into the strong tracking CKF method. The new fading factor introduction method expanded the number of fading factors from one to two with reselected introduction positions. The relationship between the two fading factors as well as the general calculation method can be derived based on Taylor expansion. Obvious superiority of the newly suggested fading factor introduction method is demonstrated according to different nonlinearity of the measurement function. Equivalent calculation method can also be established while applied to CKF. Theoretical analysis shows that the strong tracking CKF can extract the third-order term information from the residual and thus realize second-order accuracy. After optimizing the strong tracking algorithm process, a Fast Strong Tracking CKF (FSTCKF) is finally established. Two simulation examples show that the novel FSTCKF improves the robustness of traditional CKF while minimizing the algorithm time complexity under various conditions. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper investigates the role played by informational frictions in college and the workplace. We estimate a dynamic structural model of schooling and work decisions, where individuals have imperfect information about their schooling ability and labor market productivity. We take into account the heterogeneity in schooling investments by distinguishing between two- and four-year colleges, graduate school, as well as science and non-science majors for four-year colleges. Individuals may also choose whether to work full-time, part-time, or not at all. A key feature of our approach is to account for correlated learning through college grades and wages, whereby individuals may leave or re-enter college as a result of the arrival of new information on their ability and productivity. Our findings indicate that the elimination of informational frictions would increase the college graduation rate by 9 percentage points, and would increase the college wage premium by 32.7 percentage points through increased sorting on ability. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Detecting racial discrimination using observational data is challenging because of the presence of unobservables that may be correlated with race. Using data made public in the <i>SFFA v. Harvard</i> case, we estimate discrimination in a setting where this concern is mitigated. Namely, we show that there is a substantial penalty against Asian Americans in admissions with limited scope for omitted variables to overturn the result. This is because <i>(i)</i> Asian Americans are substantially stronger than whites on the observables associated with admissions and <i>(ii)</i> the richness of the data yields a model that predicts admissions extremely well. Our preferred model shows that Asian Americans would be admitted at a rate 19% higher absent this penalty. Controlling for one of the primary channels through which Asian American applicants are discriminated against|the personal rating|cuts the Asian American penalty by less than half, still leaving a substantial penalty. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Over the past 20 years, elite colleges in the US have seen dramatic increases in applications. We provide context for part of this trend using detailed data on Harvard University that was unsealed as part of the <i>SFFA v. Harvard</i> lawsuit. We show that Harvard encourages applications from many students who effectively have no chance of being admitted, and that this is particularly true for African Americans. African American applications soared beginning with the Class of 2009, with the increase driven by those with lower SAT scores. Yet there was little change in the share of admits who were African American. We show that this change in applicant behavior resulted in substantial convergence in the overall admissions rates across races yet no change in the large cross-race differences in admissions rates for high-SAT applicants. </p></div>

We examine how this increased competition affected the admissions advantage that legacies and athletes (LA) receive. Using 18 years of Harvard admissions data, we show that non-legacy, non-athlete (NLNA) applications expanded while LA applications remained flat. Yet, the share of LA admits remained stable, implying substantial increases in LA admissions advantages. Viewed through the lens of an admissions model, stability in the share of LA admits implies a strong degree of complementarity in the number of LA admits and overall admit quality. </p></div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </p></div><br>

    <p style="margin:0"> <b>Language Environment at Home and Academic Achievement During Early Childhood</b> <br> with <a href="http://www.jgjiagao.com/">Jia Gao</a> and <a href="http://www.lewangecon.com/">Le Wang</a>. <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process&mdash;language environment at home&mdash;on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</p></div><br>

    <p style="margin:0"> <b>The Spatial Distribution of College Majors</b> <br> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-p-t-mcguire/">Joel McGuire</a>. <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</p></div><br>
